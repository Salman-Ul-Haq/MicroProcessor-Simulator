# MicroProcessor-Simulator
This is the MicroProcessor Simulator in which i implement in c# and simulate 8,16,32,64 bit Microprocessor and show the Fetch, Decode and Execute cycle.
A microprocessor is also known as a central processing unit in which numbers of peripheralsâ€™ are fabricated on a single chip. It has ALU (arithmetic and logic unit), a control unit, registers, bus systems and a clock to perform computational tasks. Current microprocessors can access 64 GB memory. Depending on width of data microprocessors can process 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit. There are multiple simulators like 8085 Ultimate Simulator which is used for translating Assembly code to Machine code and translating Machine code to Assembly code just in a moment. Some computer simulators model the architecture of a simple computer and has all the basic features. In this Project, we will show the process of Fetch, Execute and Decode Cycle of the CPU. The CPU is designed to understand a set of instructions - the instruction set. It fetches the instructions from the main memory and executes them.
